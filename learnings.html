      This data aims to explain the relationship between factors that effect
      people's overall happiness.
      <br>
      <br>
      When you look at the data, it first comes to obvious how both life
      satisfaction and people's happiness have been decreasing since the 90's.
      If we look at some countries like Chile, there is it strong correlation
      between people's happiness and the importance of religion (religion being
      increasing steadily). However, this cannot be thought as a commonly
      occuring phenoma, since it does not occur with every country or even culture.

      We can also look into factors such as friends; the data suggests that
      they are less valued in countries in Latina America than, for example,
      nordic countries where people also feel generally happier.

      Another notion, when brushing through the data, is how politics effect
      the nation's mental health. Countries, that do not feel like politics
      is extremely important (such as Spain, Ukraine, and Chile) seem
      to also feel more miserable than others. The data could perhaps suggest a poor
      state of the country or an untrustworthy political system.

      A another factor worth looking into could be, for example, people's
      motivations changing during the past 25 years. Notice how leasure time
      is being valued much more important than what it did in the 90's? This could
      be explained by the increase of technology and economy that allows taking
      more time off from work and everyday chores. A strong exception for this seems
      to be China, that has kept its leisure time below the charts the whole time.
      This could be explained by the hard working culture that China is known for
      or by the fact how the data was gathered. The data consists of only the
      percentage of people who answered highest on the Likert Scale-like survey.
      This might end up being biased of how likely are people to admit what motivates
      them. In other words,it could feel more modest to say that a person does not place
      leisure time above all else. This could, in one way, explain why China rates mostly lower
      than other countries in all eight categories.
